        let name = 'Sid';
        let name2 = 'Ven';
        console.log(name, name2);
        name = "Siddhu";
        console.log(name, name2);

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        let team = players;
        console.log(players, team);
        

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        team[3] = 'Sid';
        console.log(players, team);

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way
        let team2 = Array.from(players);
        
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        let team3 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        let team4 = [...players];

        let team5 = players.slice();

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

// and think we make a copy:
        const cap = person;
        // console.log(person, cap);
        // person.age = 90;
        // console.log(person, cap);

// how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 90});
        person.name= 'Sid';
        console.log(person, cap2);

// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = {...person};
        person.age=100;
        console.log(person, cap3);

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        const sid = {
            name: 'Sid',
            social: {
                insta: 'sid93'
            }
        };
        console.clear();
        console.log(sid);
        const dev = Object.assign({}, sid); // Does not copy second level

        const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sid));
